## üîÅ Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)

To make review easier:

- Make sure your PRs merge cleanly
- Keep commits small, focused, and logical
- Follow the existing code and folder structure
- For documentation: use the same tone and formatting as the rest of the docs
- Reference related issues when possible
- Avoid unnecessary changes (e.g., whitespace-only edits)

### Commit Style

- Use the **imperative mood**: `Add login button`, not `Added login button`
- Reference issues or pull requests when relevant
- Limit the first line to **72 characters**
